        <h1>-1*Ascension</h1>

        <p>My brain can’t even think, I’m writing half asleep trying to make something of the
        deprivation I’ve been privileged. Usually times like this are sweet, something I
        cherish and never share for fear of embarrassment. But something about this
        makes me feel different. No, tonight I don’t feel empty, I just feel sad. The
        feeling of "inability" fills my head and I’ve already determined that I’m going to
        sleep through the a.m. The absence of happiness? Endless. My enjoyment of
        competition? Past it. The homework I’ve been assigned? Scrap it. The me who once
        was is no more now; all I want to do is give up. Maybe depression is still
        present but that conflicts with why my eyes are tearing up.<br><br>

        I don’t know how anyone can be happy in this wasteland. Honestly, it's as if
        everyone is a robot programmed to do something destined. Yet I feel absent in my
        objective. Call me dumb, call me young, call me high strung; but the fact that
        everyone continues to walk around every day to do the same things and progress
        in the same way is insane. Does anyone else have a brain, can anyone else
        complain about the mundane? "What's mundane?" I hear you say... To me,
        it's exactly what you do to make death shy away. The constant work and no play;
        the pressure that ever builds and fails to dissipate. I guess the programming in
        my brain fails to include dopamine or something.<br><br>

        People always ask what my goals are and how I have fun. Valid questions and I
        won’t be dissing them in the slightest. My goals are to have kids and raise them
        to be more grateful than I've ever been. I want to move to a place where I can
        sit quietly and live while my wife and I constantly test our creative side. To
        publish a book and have people, even if just for a page, see through my eyes; to
        have no one know about my life yet feel how I feel on the inside. I want to live
        a life without working a nine to five. Just avoid criticism; I'm already my
        hardest critic.<br><br>

        The more you know about me, the more blinded you'll be; I plaster a façade to my
        face which is removed for the most trusted in my life. I can fit the number of
        friends on one hand which have read what I’ve writ and only a couple more have
        experienced me lament. With this I must stop, the cabin lights have lit. Captain
        said to buckle up, there'll be a bit of turbulence on the descent.</p>
