        <h1>Waning</h1>
        <p>
            “The Hunter's Moon waxed round in the night sky, and put to flight all the lesser stars...”<br>
            ― J.R.R. Tolkien<br><br><br>
            
            Peacefully the telescope sits aimed at the Moon; everything’s unmoving save for the drift of the sky as its contents makes their course across the temporarily illuminated void. My shoes make an icy crunch as I shift them on the shingles and turn to meet a silhouette shimmying its way down from the apex of the roof. I ignore him. Just my friend’s mountain climbing brother; nothing new. My gaze returns to the sky: a barren land dotted by pinpricks which peek into heaven… the host for all which is below and a carriage for a rock who glows. Yet a slow, delicate process is in course. One that’ll change the silver we all know into a rusty hue. One that’ll dim the Moon into something new. One that’ll open my eyes and let my pupils grow.<br><br>
            Over the next 30 minutes a chain reaction takes place. An old life of mine is erased and a seed is dropped in its place, a dog cries havoc and transforms into a wolf of war, the sky reforms into an orb dotted by much more. Everyone is absorbed into the Moon and a tense chord comes in tune. My gaze breaks from the Moon and turns to a figure anew. A new figure to tune of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 2. A contrast to the night, the brightest star in my sight.<br><br>
            A nebula appears to form and my thoughts begin to distort. A warmed breath by my cheek rises above into a breeze only to be torn apart by its sheer force while the hostile nature bores holes in our streetwear. At this time we return to the inside; through the window we climb and down we go for a glass of red wine. Rosy cheeks all around and not a single frown is found - the patriots won! - could this night get anymore profound?! <br><br>
            At around 2am, sounds begin to subdue, and the full Moon is, again, found with a bright silver hue. It feels weird writing from this point of view: sitting in a car under millions of stars where only a tiny few beat the bloom from the Moon. What more could I be missing? All the details are right there, but perspectively prove inferior. I guess with time even the brightest of things wane, not to disappoint, but instead to expand my gaze.<br><br>
