        <h1>Orange to Gray</h1>
        <p>
            The night is bright; streetlights illuminate the flight of cars as they cruise
            past I and the cigars by my side. A linear route is produced at the derive of my
            mind; physically wrapping the block while my wrist politely dispenses ash
            behind. This is no crime and all should turn out fine yet my mind disrupts all
            that is straight and makes everything gray fall out of line. Gusts of wind rip
            at my jacket and slap my hand, yet it finds it hard to offend the ember within.
            With each breath in, the imminent exhale prevails at disrupting the air so
            disciplined; latching onto the atmosphere where it disappears only to return
            amidst a faint glow or go until another night that illuminates the flight of my
            mind...
