        <h1>The Candle</h1>
        <p>
            Atop a mantle they sit. Originally only one was lit. 
            But around it there persists a dozen or more bent 
            and aged candles, coated with waves of dried wax. 
            They, too, have been there since the first spark hit 
            the first candle's wick, but they burn bright, hot, 
            without constraint. They throw embers to other flax 
            igniting a flame much brighter than that of the last; 
            dripping molten wax which burns... stings, yet dries fast. 
            <br><br>
            Sometimes a gust will blow through blowing out a few. 
            Though, only putting out the candles that are bent and sqewed; 
            never the candle in the middle: the one which casts a dim hue, 
            the one which will always out last those which are brood. 
            It persists through the grim, an essence of life deep within; 
            offsetting the rushed dynamic around, it lives a life slowed down. 
            One might think the gust was from the chimney or out of the blue. 
            But, let it be known, the gust came from nonother than you. 
            <br><br>
            One day the dim candle will lick its last whim 
            puttering out with nothing but a base so slim. 
            The candles which once huddled around him 
            have long since melted to the ground - puddled. 
            No fighting, no struggle; no rush, no hustle. 
            It's with this that the room goes dark - vacant - 
            save the lingering scent of a life once so prominent.
