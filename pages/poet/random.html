        <h1>Randomness</h1>
        <p>I watch the waves crash below and see the sand mold and mesh with itself to
           construct a new form. Blue horizon contrasted by a slow moving, yellow orb.
           Ocean foam washes up on the shore and disappears with unaggressive *pops* which,
           in unison, sounds like a calm fizzle. In the sky a wave unfolds and blue changes
           to gold and from gold to cold night fall. It's funny living in this world of
           law. How much we can modify what governs us all. With the coming of night,
           street lights begin their 12 hour fight against the anti-light. The plane which
           I ride continues to glide in the night sky. <br><br>Once the night left us unaware but
           now we no longer despair. For humans inevitably pull out their hair and solve an
           issue that isn't even there. We find patterns and try to take advantage of this
           new found knowledge. Airports love us monkeys. Ignoring efficiency for money and
           playing with our "need" for luxury. Charging absurdly for our security and
           herding us like sheep in a butchery. Good thing I'm enjoying the thought of
           uncertainty right now. Letting it manifest itself as reality. Letting the
           certain become random again. Letting things not be as they intend, but as they
           are. Seeing only the surface and seeing no more. A penny, in fact, has millions
           of layers, but no one needs to investigate all that to know it's worth a single
           cent. With this I retreat to ignorance and feign universal incompetence. I will
           be like all monkeys and live a life of randomness.</p>
        <br><br><p>____________________________________________</p><br><br>
        <p>The only thing certain is I.<br>
           for each degree of separation I<br>
           step out, the certainty diminishes.<br><br>
   
           Even those that I know best ultimately stem from a root of randomness.
           I do not wish to know all. Not knowing allows for bonds to be formed.
           The feeling of connection, perhaps; the result of exposure. Exposure which leads
           to trust and understanding. Both things that resonate with and instill within
           a person's mind the feeling of friendship, love, and companionship.<br><br>
   
           Such feeling can be extrapolated to our surroundings. Places are ultimately random.
           An alien stranded on earth would fail to understand the grid-like structure of our
           cities if their homeland wasn't so geometric. Becoming familiar with your immediate
           proximity provides a feeling of comfort and understanding. You develop an unspoken
           bond with places you've visited and explored.<br><br>
   
           Such ideas, in fact, can be applied to all that is unfamiliar.
           The unfamiliar is strange, it's random, it's fluid and ever changing.</p><br><br><br><br>
