        <h1>Drives</h1>
        <p>
            A smooth Blue orb that floats is what's in view.
            Hovering and bouncing over the road which
            flows underneath it, there's no one through
            the window, but a mind of its own is still
            within. It constantly teases you, like it'll ditch
            you, then slows as if it's not moving - still
            with you. A Yellow light pierces the Gray hue
            and the orb is flung through it's absent sinew.
            Now alone and without objective, everything halts.<br><br>


            No guides. No rush. No pleasures. Life is hushed.
            Yellow flicks to Red and Red embers emerge - a default
            for when things stop. Your head feels a rush
            but the glass tells you your cheaks, they're flush.
            It's late, but that's not new. You're drained 
            and that's only on you. You see Green in your view
            just as a sinuously framed figure stares back at you. 
            Oh how it is to be constrained to your own head,
            you think, just as you watch the Yellow turn to Red.

            Author's notes:
            
            <br><br>
            Drives is about how we all get trapped in our own heads; we all get stuck in bad places.
            The first paragraph is how when you're looking outward it's easier to move
            forward. But, the second paragraph contrasts this idea and represents just how easily one can get stuck, stagnant in objective.
            The light is literally trying to will you forward on your journey, but 
            you can't stop looking at yourself - you can't get out of your head; you're trapped.
