            Understanding is something that comes with time.<br>
            And it’s funny how when we’re young we get so annoyed at the lack of understanding people seem to have.<br>
            Yet, as we age, our understanding of not only the world increases, but of people (their stresses, ticks, wants, fears, ). And we take this for granted.<br>
            <br>

            There are some things about people that we can never understand. <br>
            Are the most inhuman of us the hardest to understand?<br>
            <br>

            Tho it must be added that understanding, or the illusion of such, is more detrimental than complete lack of understanding. Or perhaps this “illusion of confidence” is beneficial. Guess it depends on the context..<br>
            <br>

            Are the least confident people the most understanding;<br>
            while those that are most confident misunderstand their own sense of understanding?<br>
            <br>

            I guess this is only natural given understanding is rooted in belief.<br>
            <br>

            For a second I thought there might actually be some people who really just fail to see their own misunderstandings. <br>
            <br>

            But that’s illogical. Such a reality is unavoidable given the fact that they’re human. The natural thought process must contain some balance of doubt and disillusioned belief.<br>
            <br>

            Guess that means there are, of course, extremes to this example. And it’s just unfortunate that the disillusioned of us dominate the living space.<br>
            <br>

            Yet the most understanding of us fail to react due to repeatedly being met with unparalleled aggression that can only rise from those that embody superiority.<br>
            <br>

            It’s unfortunate, I suppose. But the disillusioned people will have more struggles later on, probably when it’s too late to care. But it’ll happen.<br>
            <br>

            But the same can be said about those that understand...<br>
            <br>

            I hate the human condition<br>
            Why are the conclusions always the same<br>
            It’s always: balance this, balance that; repent this, repent that; regret what wasn’t balanced; peace; quiet.<br>
            <br>

            One life isn’t enough. Two lives isn’t enough. Nor three, nor four….<br>
            <br>

            Understanding is so specific<br>
            Yet we handle it so abstractly<br>
            <br>

            We make sense of the world with abstractions<br>
            <br>

            Our perspective of things are extrapolations of all that is our past. Maybe not all, but our memory of the past and it’s current state of conforming, fading, and adjusting.<br>
            <br>

            With so many dynamics, understanding - like all things human - fades to randomness and obscurity. It’s just another illusion propped up by our own will to believe.<br>
            <br>

            Will to believe. Hah. <br>
            Funny how I believe only what’s negative.<br>
            What am I fighting? Why’s my illusions so self-deprecating?<br>
            <br>
