        <h1>Can I Get a Break?</h1>
        <p>
            I am annoyed. It’s never my mind which is behind my disinterest in time. Time
            keeps moving and I manage it reasonably well. However, my body is indefinitely
            trapped in a well. There’s a disconnect between my mind and body. And both are
            slowly failing at the loss of the other. The A’s the Bs and the Cs bring fourth
            to reality the extent to which I would be considered “lazy.” Yet time is what
            saves me. Its march to eternity fills me, and all, with uncertainty. Uncertainty
            with which my mind and being have come to peace. So please spare me my
            “oh-so-humble” community; my internal screams caused by thee already deafen my
            responsibilities. Y’all already mute me and my body can’t plea from fear of
            humility. My mind envies all that is a dream filling my body with anxiety that
            paralyzes me. While my thoughts disassociate, my body elates at the idea of a
            date he can break away; free.
