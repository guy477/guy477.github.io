        <h1>Distrust</h1>
        <p>
            The worst irregularity to be replayed in my brain. No one, no thing can be more
            than a pain that corrodes the very essence of my existence.
            It’s a little issue, some might say, but when it is to the extent which it is in me
            the complications become borderline insanity.
            what's that you say? oh, I see, you are going to go have fun.
            why does that involve me? why does the need to mention the very someone that
            brings me insecurities come to be. discuss them all day then go, seemingly, with only they?<br><br>
            
            This isn’t something crazy. This is human, you see. Both you and I live through this
            counter to prosperity.<br><br>
            
            I wish I could refocus this third eye in me to the work that needs to be complete.
            Visual repeats ingrained in my brain are all I see when my eye lids close
            dreams plagued by this ignorant determinant that often offsets
            the reality of the situation.<br>
            Yet, when I sit back after finding peace - watch the issue play out - 
            I’m cursed with finding out that this "irregularity" is reality.
            The craziness that crippled me bites this frayed out cord
            that is already sworn to never be repaired.<br><br>
            At what point will I trust what I think?<br>
            At what point will I trust those around me?
