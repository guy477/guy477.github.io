        <h1>Belief</h1>
        <p>A place for thought.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Reasoning is the root to absurdity;<br>
           in a world growing more chaotic with the increasing number of 'individuals,' the rhyme
           and reason that meanders us through the day to day begins to fade into obscurity. What we
           perceive as existence, choice, and belief is, in essence, the result of a constant internal/
           external balancing act brought about by one's will to give into the meaningless or divulge in disillusion.

        <p>We all live lives of extrapolation. One must first understand themselves before they can begin to comprehend existence.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Every time I write with the intent to answer I am filled with anger and a feeling
           of anxiousness. The only thing that comes of it is terror and another party filled
           with labor to dismantle what I said. where's the joy when I can never be right;
           will I ever be heard if my works are better off burned?
