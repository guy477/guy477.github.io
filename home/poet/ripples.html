            Skipping Stones<br>
            A blur as it glides above the water, high; <br>
            gray and small: like a distant bird in the sky.<br>
            Angled up - hopeful - with a heart so soulful,<br>
            though a face stone cold, the force down is two fold.<br>
            with a slight splash and luck from hope of the past, <br>
            a bounce makes the flight last - save ripples so vast.<br><br>

            A little lower the bird now flies<br>
            and the energy slowly subsides.<br>
            Looking up with a sigh, heavy... full...<br>
            the tug morphs into a steady pull.<br>
            A vision once so vast is now halved<br>
            by a smooth surface mirrored like glass.<br><br>

            Time suddenly just whisks by<br>
            and the surface magnifies<br>
            the fast falling gray oval; <br>
            everything is now focal.<br>
            Moments go by way too fast<br>
            forcing 'meaning' to get passed.<br><br>

            With a heave and sigh<br>
            and ripples nearby,<br>
            all that is hopeful<br>
            turns anecdotal<br>
            of how one's downcast<br>
            is being steadfast.<br><br>

            No outcry,<br>
            just a sky<br>
            blue and gold<br>
            to behold.<br>
            With the last<br>
            thoughts amassed...<br><br>

            Spl<br>
            as<br>
            h<br>
            .<br>
