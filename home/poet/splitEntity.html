        <h1>A Split Entity</h1>
        <p>
            To me, there's something beautiful about unreciprocated love:
            A phrase tainted by society, a phrase that marks instability.
            It's become provocative in stature and establishes expectance,
            it dictates that to receive one must first give.
            <br><br>
            So it is natural, you see, to give a lot to others for me,<br>
            yet it's selfish, you see, when others aren't like me<br>
            and feel no need to go out of their way to present me.
            <br><br>
            So this is how I lived, for years on end; casting a line
            out to space and gambling for a slight nibble in its place.
            Constantly throwing my hands to the sky asking "why.."
            Only to turn and walk away with dried tears in my eyes.
            <br><br>
            That is until I found an entity orbiting my life.
            It's been there for years observing my lines with
            a head cocked to the side. "Just a little too far.."
            is what I'd say as I walk away only to try another day.
            This went on for weeks, months, years until a tear
            dropped from my nose and landed in the pond, rippling
            the mirrored surface and distorting all I believed.
            <br><br>
            It's only then that I looked up to the sky
            with my hands calmly placed by my side
            I tilted my head to the right
            at the same time my line caught a bite.
            I dropped my rod and it was pulled in the pond.
            Pondering the perfect way to respond:
            how to communicate I'm no longer lost.
            <br><br>
            After all my failed casts Iâ€™m greeted with peace.
            I live in my own world, as do thee. 
            And there is more than just a smooth surface
            under which you can't see.
            <br><br>
            Looking to the horizon, a smile crosses my face.
            The Moon is setting, but I know it'll return another day
            when I can once again feel it's embrace.
            Until then I keep my eyes level and step into new space.

            Author's notes:
            I weave together parts of my past with my own inner dialogue
            to try and create imagery that demonstrates mental development.
            <br><br>
            In A Split Entity I take a look at my stance on love
            and realize it's not a give and receive thing like I had 
            thought before. Instead, It's a measure of consistency and
            understanding. I draw heavily from times I've spent with
            a dear friend of mine and metaphorically relate the 
            mental fracturing of me as a disillusioned fisherman
            to the dissolvement of my own internal longing for 
            affection and love from those around me.
