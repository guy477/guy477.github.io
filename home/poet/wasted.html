        <h1>Wasted</h1>
        <p>
            
            What are you supposed to do<br>
            When you’re down and blue..<br>
            The world is filled with vices;<br>
            Vices to give you brain a clue<br>
            That what’s to do is subdue.<br><br>

            Nothing natural is helpful.<br>
            All my body does is pull<br>
            Itself into a hole of despair.<br>
            From the waking moment<br>
            I’m bound by wasted thought<br>
            Dispelled solely to relate.<br>
            Yet tear drops and failure<br>
            Are all that ever elate.<br><br>

            What A waste.<br>
            What A waste.<br>
            This body. Fuck my face<br>
            And all that it hides:<br>
            The forefront of a mind<br>
            So caught up in time<br>
            That with each tick<br>
            More is at stake;<br>
            More waste -<br>
            What A waste<br><br>

            I hate this;<br>
            I’ve faked this.<br>
            This school,<br>
            This relationship<br>
            With my history.<br>
            A facade<br>
            I, for a moment,<br>
            Got caught in.<br>
            Only for my<br>
            Human condition<br>
            To work it’s way<br>
            Back in<br><br>

            And tear apart the line<br>
            I drew out, the path, the kind:<br>
            The peaceful diss-in-my-mind.<br>
            My walkings a crime<br>
            To my own waking time.<br>
            Wasted: A waste;<br>
            Useless and unsafe.<br><br>

            Simmering with hate<br>
            Turned so deeply inward<br>
            You can’t discern a thought<br>
            From a sunburn. A singularity<br>
            With a pull, to me, so cruel.<br><br>

            Yet people see the facade:<br>
            The wasted face <br>
            With no embrace.<br>
            A waste of space,<br>
            A waste of taste,<br>
            A waste of feel:<br>
            Just Waste.<br><br><br>

            All I produce are useless, pointless, overburdening dribbles of thought.<br>
