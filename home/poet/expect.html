        <h1>The Concept of Life and its Inherently Endless Abundance of Expectation</h1>
        <p>
            
            The ability to write with no goal is so simple. It is simply an exercise of life. You begin a journey - sometimes with a destination in mind,
            other times not - that will come to an inevitable end - sometimes expected - sometimes unexpected. All that happens in between is up to you. 
            It is your story, your life is the page that grows with experience and no edits. The aimlessness, atleast for me, is the main driving force;
            though for others, the aimlessness gives no direction. A brief thought on this point is as follows: those that thrive in the aimless see
            the world as a reflection of themselves; those that thrive with direction see themselves in those and that which is around them; 
            those that still find uncertainty in what they're doing are likely either explorers stuck on a linear route or lost hoping to find a destination.
            Yet the truth of the matter is no one ever truly feels content with their life's path; the human condition - their human condition - will persist
            on any path. The real threat is falling victim to the illusion that you are stuck in one way of life and attempting a full swing to the other. Tho, this
            introduces the issue of change. How ready are you for the risks that come with change? What change is purposeful? Is it fair to say any change is
            reasonable once the individual understands its associated risks? And, no matter the answer to the last few questions, is change even controllable;
            can any person truly say they directed their own life in an ever-meaningful way? The answer to these questions are all rooted in expectation. Expectation of
            the individual. This expectation is the driving force of purpose. What you see as expectation - whether you placed it on yourself or it's been
            placed on you - ultimately seeds the change you want to see and directs the journey indefinitely. Expectation is self-fulfilling; it is the recursive
            consciousness that enables us to balance "right" and "wrong," to reason about difficult situations, to take that first step. If you feel trapped,
            try taking a step in any direction. It might not feel like the right path, but perhaps that is a result of your human condition; and this is good because the
            human condition will always find a way to shuffle thought and emotion to keep things dynamic - to keep you dynamic. And if you feel trapped, take another step,
            reshuffle those placed emotions and thoughts and try again. Eventually these changes will become unconscious - you will adapt to the blur of change -
