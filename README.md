What this page is to me:
This page is no more than a place where I can post what I want, as I want, when I want.
Generally, this will revolve around my interests and, as such, the page will grow with time or, perhaps, even shrink with time. The 'me' writing this now can not know the actions future 'me' will take in regards to this page. It's really late where I am right now; perhaps I will finish this read-me another time:)

And, with all that being said, this is my webpage.
